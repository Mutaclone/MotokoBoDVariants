# MotokoBoDVariants
Book of Dragons mod dragon variants
Download the ones you want and they'll show up. It's actually fairly easy (and the folder doesn't need to be a zip file)
The mod seems to support loading without refreshing the pack either, assuming the variant you're adding is present when you initially load that variant. For example;
If you have not loaded variant 15, but you have the file for variant 15 in the correct folder, when you load variant 15 the texture will automatically show.
